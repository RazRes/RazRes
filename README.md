### Hi there, my name is Razvan 👋

#### I am a full stack developer since 2019 ✌️

It all started with full course of Java but I ended starting my first work project as an Angular frontend developer

I've been working since then as a frontender, but recently I started working on my personal projects as a full stacker. I have learned NodeJs and used MogoDB. I'm still working with ExpressJs, Mongoose, Angular, NgZorro.
